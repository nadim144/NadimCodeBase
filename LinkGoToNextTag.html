        This report contains one filter(Datum) and one Action Filter(Datumsfilter). Action filter having transformation which
        calculates the date (four years before current date). And property Auto Execution set as checked, because of that while
        exporting the report Filter Action get executed,  the calculated date is not present into the database so by default it
        will get export with first element of the filter.If the Action filter property Auto Execution set to false (unchecked)
        it will get export with currently saved filter. This is not bug, the local export working as per design.
